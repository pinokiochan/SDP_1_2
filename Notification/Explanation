Project: Notification System Using SOLID Principles

Key Objectives:

Create a unified notification system where each notification type (SMS, Email, Push Notification) follows a consistent interface.
Ensure the system can easily be extended with new notification types (e.g., Slack) without modifying existing functionality.
Implement a flexible solution that allows for sending bulk notifications to multiple recipients.

Project Structure:

Notification (interface): Defines the send() method, which all notification types must implement.
SMSNotification, EmailNotification, PushNotification: Concrete implementations of the Notification interface, each responsible for sending notifications via a specific channel.
NotificationService: Responsible for sending notifications, either individually or in bulk, by using any class that implements the Notification interface.
Factory Method: Centralizes the creation of notification objects.
